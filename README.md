HBBN - A Java Bayesian Network engine (1999)
--------------------------------------------
As of October 23, 2012, this is the official page for the HBBN software.
(It was previously (1999-2012) hosted at http://www.maths.lth.se/matstat/staff/hb/mypackages/).

The HBBN Java package is the implementation described in my Master's Thesis
[_Bayesian Networks: a Self-contained Introduction with Implementation Remarks_,
Centre for Mathematical Sciences, Lund University, 1999](http://goo.gl/hkrNZ).
It also contains several examples of graphical models and javadoc comments.
Please note that this package is *no longer maintained* (since 2000) so it will not
build out of the box. Some instructions are available in the README file. 
License: Let's decide it is GPL for everyones best.
